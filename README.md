# PassToImage

A simple Rust program to hide passwords inside of images using the least significant bit in the rgb colors of the pixels.

When downloading you have to create the additional folders `img` and `out`.<br/>
`img` is used to store the base images, while `out` is where the program will output the images with the password inside.

This is likely the worst code ever written in Rust, so beware :)
